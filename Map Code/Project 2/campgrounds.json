You can register for up to seven nights.\n\nAt other times, the campground is first-come, first-served. The ranger arrives at the campground kiosk around 8:30 am, although, a line has often formed well before then and the campground may fill before everyone in line is registered. Space is available on a per-person basis and each person wishing to register must be present. Six people will be assigned to each campsite; people in one group may be assigned to different campsites. You can register for up to the maximum stay limit (you don't need to register every day).", "id": "8F36DEB6-298E-4214-A677-064BD457996A", "reservationurl": "https://www.recreation.gov/"}]
